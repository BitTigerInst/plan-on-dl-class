## Models

1. CNN
2. RNN

## Tricks

1. CNN
   + the size of filter: why 3 * 3 instead of 1 * 1 or 5 * 5 / more tricky 3 * 1


## Cases

How to adjust deep learning architectures (temporarily focused on CNN, latter extended on RNN)

1. Kaggle Competition
   
   1.1

2. Paper

   2.1 CNN
   
       + [Deep Residual Network (Microsoft Research)]
       
   2.2 LSTM
   
       + Highway Network
       
   2.3 Deep Reinforcement Learning

# Hands on Experiences

## Applications

1. Image Caption
2. Neural Style
3. Visual Answering System (CNN + LSTM + Attention)

## Projects

Ideas based on several resources

1. Kaggle
2. Thoughts
3. Standford cs229 projects
