## Basics 

[__Theory__: Learn to Walk]

### Models

1. CNN
2. RNN

### Tricks

1. CNN
   + the size of filter: why 3 * 3 instead of 1 * 1 or 5 * 5 / more tricky 3 * 1

### Backends

1. CUDA-enable GPU
2. Libraries: Caffe (cpp)/ Torch (lua)/ Theano (python)/ Keras (theano-based, more abstract, and model-readily)
3. TensorFlow
4. Hadoop/ Spark

## Advanced 

[__Connetion__: Learn to Run / Connect to Concrete Examples]

### Cases

How to adjust deep learning architectures (temporarily focused on CNN, latter extended on RNN)

1. Kaggle Competition
   
   1.1

2. Paper

   2.1 CNN
   
       + [Deep Residual Network (Microsoft Research)]
       
   2.2 LSTM
   
       + Highway Network
       
   2.3 Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Hands on Experiences

[__Freedom__: Learn to Accelerate]

### Applications

1. Image Caption
2. Neural Style
3. Visual Answering System (CNN + LSTM + Attention)
